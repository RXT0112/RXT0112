# Zernit's resolver

This subcommand is expected to resolve various packages on the target system i.e if end-user wants to install wine then this subcommand is expected to handle it.

## Practical example
user inputs `main resolve app-compat/wine` -> various options -> Compile -> Install wine on the end-user system
